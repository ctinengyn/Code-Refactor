# Code Refactor

## What does code refactoring mean?
The purpose of code refactoring is to make the code maintainable and more efficient. The goal of code refactoring is to turn dirty code into clean code, which reduces a project's overall technical debt. 

**Dirty code** is an informal term that refers to any code that is hard to maintain and update, and even more difficult to understand and translate. 

**Clean code** is much easier to maintain, read, and understand.
